            This was my first relatively-large scale Blazor-based application. It was a lot of fun and excruciating to work with Blazor, mainly due to its completely different syntax from regular C#. I'm still not happy with how messy some parts of the code are - especially the GroupPicker code. The underlying codebase could be tidied up a bit, but it's whatever. I spent about 24 hours on this, so I consider it good enough ðŸ˜›.
